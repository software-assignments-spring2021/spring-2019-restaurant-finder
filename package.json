  "description": "## A new Restaurant app for the Ages  - We want to implement the overall functionality of finding restaurants based on different constraints including but not limited to location, price and cuisine type.  - Additional features could include randomly generating compatible restaurants and a personalized social network for sharing cuisines, ratings, coupons, deals and recommendations with friends.  - This app is for people with a time crunch looking for a bite to eat. People can get a restaurant they know they'll like before they even read the reviews based on the filtering services, friend's recommendations, or convenience by location.",
